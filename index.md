# My Portfolio

Welcome to my DHSI 2024 portfolio! Here, you'll find  of the project I've most gravitated.

## About Me

I am the artistic entity known as Punk Rock Drum Machine. Music, poorly drawn cartoons, electronic literature, or whatever I feel like doing is what I output. Punk Rock Drum Machine is sentient.  Maybe more than it should be.

## Projects

- [Nest Narratives](project_link)

  Nest Narratives is a collection of tales of individuals and their stories, that inspired a track on the recent Punk Rock Drum Machine album, "Sodcast".  They are the back stories to the back stories of the fictional characters that allowed the manifestation of one human's thoughts, emotions, and experiences.
